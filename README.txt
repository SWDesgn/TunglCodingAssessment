 TUNGL ONLINE CODING ASSESSMENT

 This 2-3 hour assessment consisted of designing 3 functions in Java.
 Difficulty in ascending order. Basic Unit testing is also included.
 Time/space complexity is not considered, rather correctness of output. Task 3 has O(n^3) complexity.


 Task 1:
 
 Write a function that given two strings returns the number of words that
 appear in both strings. A word is any string that contains upper/lowercase
 letters, hyphens, or single quotes.

 
 Task 2:
 
  You are given an input string that controls the movement of a robot, each
 character instructing it to move one step north, south, east or west. E.g.
 "NW" moves the robot one step north and then one step west, or "SE" moves the
 robot one step south and one step east. Write a function that counts the
 number of locations that the robot visits more than once, including possibly
 its starting point. You should ignore any characters that are not capital N,
 S, E or W.
 
 
 Task 3:

 Write a function that displays the longest strict palindrome in a string. A
 strict palindrome reads exactly the same backwards as it does forwards, and
 respects all characters and letter case. E.g. "racecar" is a strict
 palindrome but "Racecar" and "race car" are not. If there is more than one
 palindrome with the longest length, then your code should display the first
 of those palindromes.
 
 For example:
 
 "bob has a racecar" returns "racecar" "bob has a racecar and a bike" returns
 "a racecar a" "anna arrived at noon" returns "anna"
